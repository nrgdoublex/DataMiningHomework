Description:
This part is about Multi-Armed Bandit problem(MAB). In questions we use MAB to simulate selling-app problem, in which we decide which county is the most promising for profit and then exploit it.

Contents:
Q2(a).py: Use A/B testing to decide which county is the most promising, then exploit it.
Q2(b).py: Decide the sample size to have the statistical power of above problem greater than 0.95.
Q2(c).py: Solve the same problem by epsilon-greedy MAB.
Q2(d).py: Solve the same problem by UCB1.
Q2(e).py: Solve the same problem by Thompson sampling.
Sample.py: Function to simulate sample process
Stat_function.py: Functions to perform t-test and calculate degree of freedom.

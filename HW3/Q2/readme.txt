Description: Given Bank data, decide whether banks should or should not lend money to new customers.

Contents:
Q2(iii).py: Divide the data into training and validation set and use logistic regression to train. Plot the learning curve with respect to different training set size.
Q2(iv).py: Use k-fold cross-validation to choose a better threshold for logistic regression.
Q2(v).py: Use soft-margin SVM to solve the same problem. Compare it with logistic regression by k-fold cross validation.
Q2(vi).py: Plot ROC curve both logistic regression and soft-margin SVM above.
Q2(vii).py: Use bootstrapping to get different AUC of the ROC curves, describe and plot its distribution.
clean_data: some useful functions to help clean and extract data.
